class ForeignModelField extends Field {
    /**
     * @var Model $model Contains the Model object of the foreign Model this Field's value relates to.
     */
    public Model $model;

    /**
     * Defines the ForeignModelField object and sets its options.
     * @param string $model_name The name of the foreign Model class this field relates to. This should be the name of an
     * existing Model class in the \RESTAPI\Models namespace, but should not include the \RESTAPI\Models namespace prefix.
     * @param string $model_field The field on the assigned $model_name class that this field's value relates to. For
     * example, if this Fields value must be an existing Gateway model object's `name`, you would set $model_name to
     * `Gateway` and $model_field to `name`. Note: If this field is not a unique field, related models will be matched
     * on a first-match basis.
     * @param string $model_field_internal In the event that you want to store a different field value internally,
     * specify that field name here. Leave empty to use the $model_field for both the internal and representation values.
     * For example, if this field's value must be set in config as an existing Gateway model object's `name`, but you
     * want clients to reference the Gateway model object by its `id` instead, you would set $model_field to `id` and
     * $model_field_internal to `name`.
     * @param array $model_query Enter query parameters to limit which of the $model's existing objects can be
     * referenced by this field. For example, say this field's value must be set to an existing FirewallAlias object's
     * `name`, but you only want to allow `port` type aliases; you would set $model_name to `FirewallAlias`, $model_field to
     * `name`, and $model_query to `["type" => "port"]`. Defaults to all existing $model objects.
     * @param array $parent_model_query When the assigned $model_name class has a parent Model, use this variable to
     * limit the scope of which parent Model objects can have their child Models included. By default, the child
     * Models of ALL parent Models are included.
     * @param array $allowed_keywords Specific values that should always be allowed, even if they don't relate to the
     * assigned Model or its fields.
     * @param bool $required If `true`, this field is required to have a value at all times.
     * @param bool $unique If `true`, this field must be unique from all other parent model objects. Enabling this
     * option requires the Model $context to be set AND the Model $context must have a `config_path` set.
     * @param mixed|null $default Assign a default string value to assign this Field if no value is present.
     * @param string $default_callable Defines a callable method that should be called to populate the default value
     * for this field. It is strongly encouraged to use a default callable when the default is variable and may change
     * dynamically.
     * @param array $choices An array of value choices this Field can be assigned. This can either be an indexed array
     * of the exact choice values, or an associative array where the array key is the exact choice value and the array
     * value is a verbose name for the choice. Verbose choice name are used by ModelForms when generating web pages
     * for a given Model.
     * @param string $choices_callable Assign a callable method from this Field object OR the parent Model context to
     * execute to populate choices for this field. This callable must be a method assigned on this Field object OR the
     * parent Model object that returns an array of valid choices in the same format as $choices. This is helpful when
     * choices are dynamic and must be populated at runtime instead of pre-determined sets of values.
     * @param bool $allow_empty If `true`, empty strings will be allowed by this field.
     * @param bool $allow_null If `true`, null values will be allowed by this field.
     * @param bool $editable Set to `false` to prevent this field's value from being changed after its initial creation.
     * @param bool $read_only If `true`, this field can only read its value and cannot write its value to config.
     * @param bool $write_only Set the `true` to make this field write-only. This will prevent the field's current value
     * from being displayed in the representation data. This is ideal for potentially sensitive Fields like passwords,
     * keys, and hashes.
     * @param bool $representation_only Set to `true` to make this field only present in its representation form. This
     * effectively prevents the Field from being converted to an internal value which is saved to the pfSense config.
     * This should only be used for Fields that do not relate directly to a configuration value.
     * @param bool $many If `true`, the value must be an array of many strings.
     * @param int $many_minimum When $many is set to `true`, this sets the minimum number of array entries required.
     * @param int $many_maximum When $many is set to `true`, this sets the maximum number of array entries allowed.
     * @param string|null $delimiter Assigns the string delimiter to use when writing array values to config.
     *  Use `null` if this field is stored as an actual array in config. This is only available if $many is set to
     *  `true`. Defaults to `,` to store as comma-separated string.
     * @param string $verbose_name The detailed name for this Field. This name will be used in non-programmatic areas
     * like web pages and help text. This Field will default to property name assigned to the parent Model with
     * underscores converted to spaces.
     * @param string $verbose_name_plural The plural form of $verbose_name. This defaults to $verbose_name with `s`
     * suffixed or `es` suffixes to strings already ending with `s`.
     * @param string $internal_name Assign a different field name to use when referring to the internal field as it's
     * stored in the pfSense configuration.
     * @param string $internal_namespace Sets the namespace this field belongs to internally. This can be used to nest
     * the Fields internal value under a specific namespace as an associative array. This only applies to the internal
     * value, not the representation value.
     * @param array $referenced_by An array that specifies other Models and Field's that reference this Field's parent
     * Model using this Field's value. This will prevent the parent Model object from being deleted while it is actively
     * referenced by another Model object. The array key must be the name of the Model class that references this Field,
     * and the value must be a Field within that Model. The framework will automatically search for any existing Model
     * objects that have the referenced Field assigned a value that matches this Field's value.
     * @param array $conditions An array of conditions the field must meet to be included. This allows you to specify
     * conditions of other Fields within the parent Model context. For example, if the parent Model context has two
     * Fields, one field named `type` and the other being this field; and you only want this field to be included if
     * `type` is equal to `type1`, you could assign ["type" => "type1"] to this parameter.
     * @param array $validators An array of Validator objects to run against this field.
     * @param string $help_text Set a description for this field. This description will be used in API documentation.
