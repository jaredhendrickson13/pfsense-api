## Pull Requests

When submitting a pull request, please be aware of the various development branches used by the project and base your branch accordingly. Ensure your pull request's target branch is set to merge into the appropriate branch.

### next_patch

The `next_patch` branch is used for small bug fixes, minor documentation corrections, and other small changes that do not introduce new features or break existing functionality. Changes implemented in this branch will be included in the next patch release.

### next_minor

The `next_minor` branch is used for new features, enhancements, fixes, and other changes that do not introduce major breaking changes. Breaking changes _are_ allowed in minor release as long as the impact is minimal and justified. Changes implemented in this branch will be included in the next minor release.

### next_major

The `next_major` branch is dedicated to major changes to the projects structure, schemas, and overall functionality. Pull requests to this branch are allowed, but are rarely accepted as the branch is intended for fundamental changes to the project. Changes implemented in this branch will be included in the next major release.

### master

The `master` branch reflects the latest stable release of the project. Pull requests should _not_ be made to this branch directly. Instead, pull requests should be made to one of the other branches and merged into `master` when a new release is ready. Notable exceptions to this rule are:

- Emergency security fixes that need to be applied to the latest stable release.
- Dependency updates that do not break existing functionality.
- Documentation updates that are not tied to a specific release.

## Project Structure

The majority of the pfSense REST API package code can be found at `pfSense-pkg-RESTAPI/files/usr/local/pkg/RESTAPI`.
The project utilizes PHP namespaces to organize its codebase.

Below is a brief overview of the project's structure:

### RESTAPI/

The main namespace for the REST API package. All classes and interfaces are organized under this namespace or a child
namespace within the `RESTAPI/` directory.

### .resources/

While not a PHP namespace, this directory contains common resources and tools used by the REST API package. This includes:

#### cache/

Contains the cache files for the REST API package. Cache files are typically JSON datasets populated by [\RESTAPI\Core\Cache](https://pfrest.org/php-docs/classes/RESTAPI-Core-Cache.html) child classes and are refreshed on the schedule defined in the class.

#### vendor/

Contains additional PHP libraries and classes required by the REST API package. Because pfSense does not include a PHP package manager, these libraries are installed to this directory via composer when the package is built.

#### scripts/

Contains helper scripts for the REST API package. These scripts are used to automate tasks such as generating OpenAPI documentation, running tests, and more.

### Auth/

Contains the [\RESTAPI\Core\Auth](https://pfrest.org/php-docs/classes/RESTAPI-Core-Auth.html) child classes. [Auth classes](BUILDING_CUSTOM_AUTH_CLASSES.md) are used to define and manage authentication methods for the REST API package.

### Caches/

Contains the [\RESTAPI\Core\Cache](https://pfrest.org/php-docs/classes/RESTAPI-Core-Cache.html) child classes. [Cache classes](BUILDING_CUSTOM_CACHE_CLASSES.md) are used to define and manage cache data and files for the REST API package.

### ContentHandlers/

Contains the [\RESTAPI\Core\ContentHandler](https://pfrest.org/php-docs/classes/RESTAPI-Core-ContentHandler.html) child classes. [ContentHandler classes](BUILDING_CUSTOM_CONTENT_HANDLER_CLASSES.md) are used to define and manage the supported `content-type` and `accept` header options for the REST API package.

### Core/

Contains the [core classes and interfaces](https://pfrest.org/php-docs/namespaces/restapi-core.html) for the REST API package framework.

### Dispatchers/

Contains the [\RESTAPI\Core\Dispatcher](https://pfrest.org/php-docs/classes/RESTAPI-Core-Dispatcher.html) child classes. [Dispatcher classes](BUILDING_CUSTOM_DISPATCHER_CLASSES.md) are used to define and manage long-running processes that run in the background.

### Endpoints/

Contains the [\RESTAPI\Core\Endpoint](https://pfrest.org/php-docs/classes/RESTAPI-Core-Endpoint.html) child classes for the REST API package. [Endpoint classes](BUILDING_CUSTOM_ENDPOINT_CLASSES.md) are used to define, customize, and manage the REST API endpoints. Each endpoint class corresponds to a specific REST API endpoint in the pfSense web root and is responsible for dynamically generating the endpoint's PHP file in the web root.

### Fields/

Contains the [\RESTAPI\Core\Field](https://pfrest.org/php-docs/classes/RESTAPI-Core-Field.html) child classes. Field classes are used to define and manage various data types supported by the REST API and are intended to be [assigned to Model classes](BUILDING_CUSTOM_MODEL_CLASSES.md#define-field-objects).

### Forms/

Contains the [\RESTAPI\Core\Form](https://pfrest.org/php-docs/classes/RESTAPI-Core-Form.html) child classes. Forms are used to dynamically generate pfSense webConfigurator pages for a specific Model class.

### Models/

Contains the [\RESTAPI\Core\Model](https://pfrest.org/php-docs/classes/RESTAPI-Core-Model.html) child classes. [Model classes](BUILDING_CUSTOM_MODEL_CLASSES.md) are used to define and manage the data structure of the object's the REST API package interacts with (i.e. firewall rules, static routes, etc.).

### ModelTraits/

Contains PHP Traits that can be used to extend the functionality of Model classes. Traits are used to define and manage common functionality that can be shared across multiple Model classes. For example, Models that
interact with log files can use the `LogFileTrait` to add log file specific functionality to the Model.

### QueryFilters/

Contains the [\RESTAPI\Core\QueryFilter](https://pfrest.org/php-docs/classes/RESTAPI-Core-QueryFilter.html) child classes. [QueryFilter classes](BUILDING_CUSTOM_QUERY_FILTER_CLASSES.md) are used to define and manage the query filters that are used to filter data returned by the REST API. For information about writing query filters, see the [Building Custom Query Filter Classes](BUILDING_CUSTOM_QUERY_FILTER_CLASSES.md) documentation.

### Responses/

Contains the [\RESTAPI\Core\Response](https://pfrest.org/php-docs/classes/RESTAPI-Core-Response.html) child classes. Response classes are throwable classes that are used to generate and return a specific HTTP response code and message. Endpoints will automatically catch these exceptions if thrown and return the appropriate, JSON formatted response to the client along with the appropriate HTTP response code and headers.

### Tests/

Contains the [\RESTAPI\Core\TestCase](https://pfrest.org/php-docs/classes/RESTAPI-Core-TestCase.html) child classes. TestCase classes are used to define and manage the tests for the REST API package. See the [Testing](#testing) section for more information.

### Validators/

Contains the [\RESTAPI\Core\Validator](https://pfrest.org/php-docs/classes/RESTAPI-Core-Validator.html) child classes. [Validator classes](BUILDING_CUSTOM_VALIDATOR_CLASSES.md) are reusable classes that are used to validate data for a specific Field object. They are intended to be assigned to a Field object's `validators` property to perform the specific validation against that field.

### autoloader.inc

The autoloader script for the REST API package. This file can be included in your .php or .inc file's `require_once` statements to automatically load all RESTAPI classes.

!!! Tip
    The full PHP API reference for this package including documentation for all applicable classes can be
    found [here](https://pfrest.org/php-docs/).

## Style Guidelines

This projects uses opinionated code formatters to ensure a consistent code style across the project, this also ensures
that contributions are easier to review and maintain. The project uses the following code formatters:

- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) with the [PHP plugin](https://github.com/prettier/plugin-php) for PHP files
    - From the project root, run `npm install` to install Prettier and the Prettier-PHP plugin.
    - From the project root, run `./node_modules/.bin/prettier --write .` to format all files in the project.
- [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for Python files
    - From the project root, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install Black.
    - From the project root, run `black .` to format all Python files in the project.

## Building the Package From Source

Building this package requires access to a suitable FreeBSD build environment. The package must be built using the FreeBSD
version that corresponds to the pfSense version you are building for. Luckily, there are several tools available to help
you build the package:

### Scripted Build Process

#### Step 1: Install Virtualbox and Vagrant

On your development machine, install [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org) and [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com).
These tools will allow you to create a FreeBSD virtual machine for building the package with minimal effort.

#### Step 2: Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your development machine:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:jaredhendrickson13/pfsense-api.git
```

#### Step 3: Run the vagrant-build.sh script

From the project root, run the `vagrant-build.sh` script to create a FreeBSD virtual machine and build the package:

```bash
sh vagrant-build.sh
```

After the script completes, the package will be built and the resulting `.pkg` file will be located in your current
working directory.

!!! Important
    - You will need to copy this `.pkg` file to your pfSense instance and install it using `pkg`. The package will not operate correctly if installed on a non-pfSense FreeBSD system.
    - The script will not automatically destroy the virtual machine after the build process completes. You will need to manually destroy the virtual machine using `vagrant destroy` when you are finished.

#### Supported Build Environment Variables

Below are the supported environment variables to customize the build process:

- `FREEBSD_VERSION`: The version of FreeBSD to use for the build. This must be an existing Vagrant box name including the `freebsd/` prefix. The default value is `freebsd/FreeBSD-14.0-CURRENT`. For a list of available boxes, see the [Vagrant Cloud](https://app.vagrantup.com/freebsd) page.
- `BUILD_VERSION`: The version tag to give the build, this must be in a FreeBSD package version format (e.g. `0.0_0`). The default value is `0.0_0-dev`.

## Testing

Testing this package poses a number of challenges. Because pfSense is a hardened, security-focused operating system,
it is difficult to install traditional testing tools like PHPUnit. Instead, the package's framework includes a custom
[TestCase class](https://pfrest.org/php-docs/classes/RESTAPI-Core-TestCase.html) that resembles PHPUnit, but is designed 
to work within the pfSense environment without requiring additional dependencies. This project uses a mix of unit tests,
integration tests, and end-to-end tests to ensure the package is stable and reliable. Common test cases include:

- Ensuring the package's framework functions as intended.
- Ensuring Model classes correctly configure and interact with the pfSense system. This includes testing that the
  corresponding backend services are correctly configured after a Model object is created, updated, deleted, etc.
- Ensuring that the package's endpoints correctly handle requests and return the expected responses.

It is not important to differentiate between unit, integration and end-to-end tests when writing tests for this package.
The package's testing suite is designed to run all tests in a single command and will automatically categorize tests.
The most important thing is to ensure that tests are written to sufficiently cover the expected behavior of the package.

### Writing Tests

Writing tests for the package is similar to writing tests for any other PHP project. The package's testing framework
will automatically discover and run tests that extend the package's [TestCase class](https://pfrest.org/php-docs/classes/RESTAPI-Core-TestCase.html)
and are located in the `RESTAPI/Tests/` directory. To write a test, you can create a new PHP file in the `RESTAPI/Tests/`
directory and extend the `TestCase` class. Any method within your TestCase class that begins with `test` will be run
as a test case.

Below is a simple example of a TestCase class:

```php
<?php

namespace RESTAPI\Tests;

require_once('RESTAPI/autoloader.inc');

use RESTAPI\Core\TestCase;

class MyTestCase extends TestCase
{
    public function test_something()
    {
        # Add your test logic here
        $this->assert_is_true(true);
    }
}
```

!!! Important
    The testing framework will make a copy of the pfSense configuration before the tests are run and will restore the
    configuration after the tests complete. This ensures that the tests do not modify the pfSense configuration 
    permanently which could cause issues with the firewall or remaining tests. It is still recommended that any changes
    made to the configuration during a test are removed or reverted at the end of the test.

### Running Tests

To run all tests for the package, you can use the following command:

```bash
pfsense-restapi runtests
```

To run tests that contain a specific keyword, you can use the following command:

```bash
pfsense-restapi runtests <keyword>
```

!!! Danger
    Running tests is a disruptive process and should not be done on a production pfSense instance. It is recommended to
    only run tests on a development or testing instance of pfSense. A virtual machine with snapshots is ideal for this.

## Documentation

There are three different sets of documentation for this project, each serves a different purpose and is managed by
different tools:

### Mkdocs

The pfSense REST API Guide site is built using [Mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org). These docs are mostly intended to help users
get started using the package, as well as providing an introduction to development of the package for more advanced users.
The source files for the site are written in Markdown and located in the `docs/` directory and the configuration file 
is located at `mkdocs.yml`. To start a local development server for the documentation site while you work on documentation, 
you can run the following commands:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirement.txt
mkdocs serve
```

!!! Note
    You must have Python 3 installed on your system to run the Mkdocs development server. It is recommended to setup
    a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) for this project to avoid conflicts with other 
    Python projects.

### PHPDoc

The [PHP reference documentation](https://pfrest.org/php-docs/) for this project is generated using 
[PHPDocumentor](https://www.phpdoc.org). The PHP reference provides detailed documentation for all PHP classes, functions,
script, etc. included in the package and is intended for those wishing to aide in development of the package. PHPDoc 
looks at the PHPDoc comments in the project's PHP files and generates a static HTML site with the documentation. 
The PHPDoc configuration file is located at `phpdoc.dist.xml`. There are two ways to generate the PHP documentation 
and start a local development server to view the documentation:

!!! Important
    This should be done on your local development machine and not on a pfSense instance.

#### Via Phar
```bash
# Download the phpdoc phar
wget https://phpdoc.org/phpDocumentor.phar
chmod +x phpDocumentor.phar

# Build the docs
./phpDocumentor.phar -c phpdoc.dist.xml

# Start a local development server
cd .phpdoc/build
php -S localhost:8000
```

#### Via Docker
```bash
# Build the docs using Docker
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/data phpdoc/phpdoc run -c phpdoc.dist.xml

# Start a local development server
cd .phpdoc/build
php -S localhost:8000
```

!!! Note
    This method requires you to have Docker installed and running on your system. If you do not have Docker installed, you can
    use the Phar method to generate the documentation.

### OpenAPI (Swagger UI)

The OpenAPI documentation ([Swagger UI](https://pfrest.org/api-docs/)) provides accurate documentation for the various
API endpoints and their available attributes. The OpenAPI specification is automatically generated by the package using 
properties defined in Endpoint, Model, Fields, Auth, ContentHandler and Response classes. Each of these classes have properties 
that map to OpenAPI properties and are used to generate the OpenAPI documentation. The OpenAPI documentation is 
automatically generated when the package is initially installed and the Swagger UI is accessible under 'System > 
REST API > Documentation'. If you make changes to the package's codebase, you can regenerate the OpenAPI documentation 
to include the changes by running the following command on your pfSense instance:

```bash
pfsense-restapi buildschemas
```

### GraphQL

The GraphQL schema provides accurate documentation for the various GraphQL queries and mutations available in the package.
The GraphQL schema is automatically generated by the package using properties defined in Endpoint, Models, and Fields.
Each of these classes have properties that map to GraphQL properties and are used to generate the GraphQL schema. The
GraphQL schema is automatically generated when the package is initially installed and the GraphQL schema is accessible
at /api/v2/graphql/schema. If you make changes to the package's codebase, you can regenerate the GraphQL schema to include
the changes by running the following command on your pfSense instance:

```bash
pfsense-restapi buildschemas
```
