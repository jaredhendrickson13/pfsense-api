# Native Schema

The package's framework also generates a proprietary schema that describes components of the API in more detail than 
the OpenAPI or GraphQL schemas. This is intended for third-party tools and integrations that need more context about
the API's structure, behavior and attributes. The native schema is generated by extracting data the codebases PHP class 
properties directly and use internal metadata that is not normally exposed.

## Accessing the Schema

The native schema can by obtained by making a `GET` request to the `/api/v2/schema/native` endpoint. This endpoint
does not require authentication and is accessible to all users as it only provides descriptive metadata about the API
that is already publicly available by referencing the code on GitHub.

## Understanding the Structure

Since the native schema is generated from the codebase itself, the easiest way to understand its contents is to 
review the properties available to [Endpoint](BUILDING_CUSTOM_ENDPOINT_CLASSES.md#define-__construct-method-properties),
[Model](BUILDING_CUSTOM_MODEL_CLASSES.md#define-__construct-method-properties) and [Field](BUILDING_CUSTOM_MODEL_CLASSES.md#define-field-objects)
classes. Below is a basic outline of the schema's structure:

```json
{
  "version": "v0.0.0",
  "endpoints": {
    "/endpoint/url/path": {
      ...
    }
  },
  "models": {
    "ModelName": {
      "fields": {
        "field_name": {
          ...
        },
        ...
      }
    }
  }
}
```
