# pfSense REST API

The pfSense REST API package is an unofficial, open-source REST and GraphQL API for pfSense CE and pfSense Plus
firewalls. It is designed to be light-weight, fast, and easy to use. This guide will help you get started with the REST
API package and provide you with the information you need to configure and use the package effectively.

!!! Tip
    Looking for documentation on REST API endpoints and parameters? An interactive [Swagger documentation](SWAGGER_AND_OPENAPI.md)
    site is available on your pfSense instance after [installing the package](INSTALL_AND_CONFIG.md) under 
    'System' -> 'REST API' -> 'Documentation'. Alternatively, a simplified version of the Swagger documentation is 
    available [here](https://pfrest.org/api-docs/).

!!! Note
    These docs are only applicable to the REST API v2 package and later. If you are using the legacy v1 package, please
    refer to the docs on the [legacy branch](https://github.com/jaredhendrickson13/pfsense-api/tree/legacy).
