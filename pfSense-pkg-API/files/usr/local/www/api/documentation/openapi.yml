    # Introduction
    
    pfSense API is a fast, safe, REST API package for pfSense firewalls. This
    works by leveraging the same PHP functions and processes used by pfSense's 
    webConfigurator into API endpoints to create, read, update and
    delete pfSense configurations. All API endpoints enforce input validation 
    to prevent invalid configurations from being made. Configurations made via API 
    are properly written to the master XML configuration and the correct backend configurations 
    are made preventing the need for a reboot. All this results in the fastest, safest, and 
    easiest way to automate pfSense!

    # Requirements
    
    - pfSense CE 2.5.0 or later is supported. pfSense Plus is NOT compatible
    with this API and will break your pfSense Plus installation. (older pfSense
    CE versions may be compatible with older versions of pfSense API)
    
    - pfSense API requires a local user account in pfSense. The same permissions
    required to make configurations in the webConfigurator are required to make 
    calls to the API endpoints.
    
    - While not an enforced requirement, it is **strongly** recommended that you
    configure pfSense to use HTTPS instead of HTTP. This ensures that login
    credentials and/or API tokens remain secure in-transit.

    # Installation
    
    To install pfSense API, simply run the following command from the pfSense
    shell:<br><br>

    ```
    pkg add
    https://github.com/jaredhendrickson13/pfsense-api/releases/latest/download/pfSense-2.5-pkg-API.txz
    && /etc/rc.restart_webgui
    ```<br><br>

    To uninstall pfSense API, run the following command:<br><br>

    ```
    pfsense-api delete
    ```<br><br>

    To update pfSense API to the latest stable version, run the following
    command:<br><br>

    ```
    pfsense-api update
    ```<br><br>

    To revert to a previous version of pfSense API (e.g. v1.1.7), run the
    following command:<br><br>

    ```
    pfsense-api revert v1.1.7
    ```<br><br>

    ### Notes: 
    
    - To install the 2.6 package, simply change the `2.5` in the install URL to
    `2.6`.
    
    - In order for pfSense to apply some required web server changes, it is
    required to restart the webConfigurator after installing the package.
    
    - If you do not have shell access to pfSense, you can still install via the
    webConfigurator by navigating to 'Diagnostics > Command Prompt' and enter the commands there.
    
    - When updating pfSense, **_you must reinstall pfSense API afterwards_**.
    Unfortunately, pfSense removes all existing packages and only re-installs
    packages found within pfSense's package repositories. Since pfSense API is
    not an official package in pfSense's repositories, it does not get
    reinstalled automatically.
    
    - The `pfsense-api` command line tool was introduced in v1.1.0. Refer to the
    corresponding documentation for earlier releases.

    # UI Settings & Documentation
    
    After installation, you will be able to access the API user interface pages
    within the pfSense webConfigurator. These will be found under System > API.
    The settings tab will allow you change various API settings such as enabled
    API interfaces, authentication modes, and more. Additionally, the
    documentation tab will give you access to an embedded documentation tool
    that makes it easy to view the full API documentation in context to your
    pfSense instance.

    ### Notes: 
    
    - Users must hold the `page-all` or `page-system-api` privileges to access
    the API page within the webConfigurator.

    # Authentication & Authorization
    
    By default, pfSense API uses the same credentials as the webConfigurator.
    This behavior allows you to configure pfSense from the API out of the box, and user passwords may be changed from 
    the API to immediately add additional security if needed. After installation, you can navigate to System > API in 
    the pfSense webConfigurator to configure API authentication. Please note that external authentication servers like 
    LDAP or RADIUS are not supported with any API authentication method at this time. 

    To authenticate your API call, follow the instructions for your configured
    authentication mode:

    <details>
        <summary>Local Database (default)</summary>

    Uses the same credentials as the pfSense webConfigurator. To authenticate
    API calls, pass in your username and password using basic authentication.
    For example:<br><br>
    
    `curl -u admin:pfsense https://pfsense.example.com/api/v1/firewall/rule`<br><br>

    _Note: in previous releases, local database authentication used the
    `client-id` and `client-token` fields in your request body to authenticate.
    This functionality still exists but is not recommended. It will be removed
    in a future release._

    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>JWT</summary>

    Requires a bearer token to be included in the `Authorization` header of your
    request. To receive a bearer token, you may make a POST request to
    /api/v1/access_token and include a `client-id` value containing your
    pfSense username and a `client-token` value containing your pfSense password
    to your payload. For example:<br><br>
    
    `{"client-id": "admin", "client-token" "pfsense"}`<br><br>
    
    Once you have your bearer token, you can authenticate your API call by adding it to the request's authorization header. (e.g.
    `Authorization: Bearer xxxxxxxx.xxxxxxxxx.xxxxxxxx`)

    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>API Token</summary>

    Uses standalone tokens generated via the UI. These are better suited to
    distribute to systems as they are revocable and will only allow API
    authentication; not UI or SSH authentication (like the local database
    credentials). To generate or revoke credentials, navigate to System > API
    within the UI and ensure the Authentication Mode is set to API token. Then
    you should have the options to configure API Token generation, generate new
    tokens, and revoke existing tokens. Once you have your API token, you may
    authenticate your API call by specifying your client-id and client-token
    within an `Authorization` header, these values must be separated by a space.
    (e.g. `Authorization: client-id-here client-token-here`)<br><br>

    _Note: In previous versions of pfSense API, the client-id and client-token
    were provided via the request payload. This functionality is still supported
    but is not recommended. It will be removed in a future release._

    </details>

    ### Authorization

    pfSense API uses the same privileges as the pfSense webConfigurator. The
    required privileges for each endpoint are stated within the API
    documentation.

    # Content Types

    pfSense API can handle a few different content types. Please note, if a
    `Content-Type` header is not specified in your request, pfSense API will
    attempt to determine the content type which may have undesired results. It is recommended you specify your 
    preferred `Content-Type` on each request.<br><br>
    
    While several content types may be enabled, `application/json` is the recommended content type. Supported content types are:

    <details>
        <summary>application/json</summary>

    Parses the request body as a JSON formatted string. This is the recommended
    content type.<br><br>

    Example:<br><br>

    ```
    curl -s -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"client-id": "admin", "client-token": "pfsense"}' -X POST https://pfsense.example.com/api/v1/services/syslogd/restart 
    ```
    
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</summary>

    Parses the request body as URL encoded parameters.<br><br>
    
    _Note: this content type is only sufficient for GET and DELETE requests._

    Example:<br><br>

    ```
    curl -s -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -X GET "https://pfsense.example.com/api/v1/system/arp?client-id=admin&client-token=pfsense"
    ```

    </details>

    # Queries
    
    pfSense API contains an advanced query engine to make it easy to query
    specific data from API calls. For endpoints supporting `GET` requests, you
    may query the return data to only return data you are looking for. To query
    data, you may add the data you are looking for to your payload. You may
    specify as many query parameters as you need. In order to match the query,
    each parameter must match exactly, or utilize a query filter to set
    criteria. If no matches were found, the endpoint will return an empty array
    in the data field. 

    <details>
        <summary>Targeting Objects</summary>
    
    You may find yourself only needing to read objects with specific values set.
    For example, say an API endpoint normally returns this response without a
    query:<br><br>

    ```json

    {
        "status":"ok",
        "code":200,
        "return":0,
        "message":"Success",
        "data": [
            {"id": 0, "name": "Test", "type": "type1", "extra": {"tag": 0}}, 
            {"id": 1, "name": "Other Test", "type": "type2", "extra": {"tag": 100}},
            {"id": 2, "name": "Another Test", "type": "type1", "extra": {"tag": 200}}
        ]
    }
    
    ```
    
    If you want the endpoint to only return the objects that have their `type`
    value set to `type1` you could add `{"type": "type1"}` to your payload. This
    returns:<br><br>

    ```json

    {
        "status":"ok",
        "code":200,
        "return":0,
        "message":"Success",
        "data": [
            {"id": 0, "name": "Test", "type": "type1", "extra": {"tag": 0}}, 
            {"id": 2, "name": "Another Test", "type": "type1", "extra": {"tag": 200}}
        ]
    }
    
    ```

    Additionally, if you need to target values that are nested within an array,
    you can add `{"extra__tag": 100}` to recursively target the `tag` value
    within the `extra` array. Note the double underscore separating the parent and child keys.
    This returns:<br><br>

    ```json

    {
        "status":"ok",
        "code":200,
        "return":0,
        "message":"Success",
        "data": [
            {"id": 1, "name": "Other Test", "type": "type2", "extra": {"tag": 100}}
        ]
    }
    
    ```

    </details>

    <details>
        <summary>Query Filters</summary>
    
    Query filters allow you to apply logic to the objects you target. This makes
    it easy to target data that meets specific criteria:<br><br>

    ### Starts With
    
    The `startswith` filter allows you to target objects whose values start with
    a specific substring. This will work on both string and integer data types.
    Below is an example response without any queries:<br><br>

    ```json

    {
        "status":"ok",
        "code":200,
        "return":0,
        "message":"Success",
        "data": [
            {"id": 0, "name": "Test", "type": "type1", "extra": {"tag": 0}}, 
            {"id": 1, "name": "Other Test", "type": "type2", "extra": {"tag": 100}},
            {"id": 2, "name": "Another Test", "type": "type1", "extra": {"tag": 200}}
        ]
    }
    
    ```
    
    If you wanted to target objects whose names started with `Other`, you could
    use the payload `{"name__startswith": "Other"}`. This returns:<br><br>

    ```json

    {
        "status":"ok",
        "code":200,
        "return":0,
        "message":"Success",
        "data": [
            {"id": 1, "name": "Other Test", "type": "type2", "extra": {"tag": 100}}
        ]
    }
    
    ```

    ### Ends With
    
    The `endswith` filter allows you to target objects whose values end with a
    specific substring. This will work on both string and integer data types.
    Below is an example response without any queries:<br><br>

    ```json

    {
        "status":"ok",
        "code":200,
        "return":0,
        "message":"Success",
        "data": [
            {"id": 0, "name": "Test", "type": "type1", "extra": {"tag": 0}}, 
            {"id": 1, "name": "Other Test", "type": "type2", "extra": {"tag": 100}},
            {"id": 2, "name": "Another Test", "type": "type1", "extra": {"tag": 200}}

        ]
    }
    
    ```

    If you wanted to target objects whose names ended with `er Test`, you could
    use the payload `{"name__endswith" "er Test"}`. This returns:<br><br>

    ```json

    {
        "status":"ok",
        "code":200,
        "return":0,
        "message":"Success",
        "data": [
            {"id": 1, "name": "Other Test", "type": "type2", "extra": {"tag": 100}},
            {"id": 2, "name": "Another Test", "type": "type1", "extra": {"tag": 200}}    
        ]
    }
    
    ```

    ### Contains
    
    The `contains` filter allows you to target objects whose values contain a
    specific substring. This will work on both string and integer data types.
    Below is an example response without any queries:<br><br>

    ```json

    {
        "status":"ok",
        "code":200,
        "return":0,
        "message":"Success",
        "data": [
            {"id": 0, "name": "Test", "type": "type1", "extra": {"tag": 0}}, 
            {"id": 1, "name": "Other Test", "type": "type2", "extra": {"tag": 100}},
            {"id": 2, "name": "Another Test", "type": "type1", "extra": {"tag": 200}}
        ]
    }
    
    ```

    If you wanted to target objects whose names contain `ther`, you could use
    the payload `{"name__contains": "ther"}`. This returns:<br><br>

    ```json

    {
        "status":"ok",
        "code":200,
        "return":0,
        "message":"Success",
        "data": [
            {"id": 1, "name": "Other Test", "type": "type2", "extra": {"tag": 100}},
            {"id": 2, "name": "Another Test", "type": "type1", "extra": {"tag": 200}}    
        ]
    }
    
    ```

    ### Less Than
    
    The `lt` filter allows you to target objects whose values are less than a
    specific number. This will work on both numeric strings and integer data
    types. Below is an example response without any queries:<br><br>

    ```json

    {
        "status":"ok",
        "code":200,
        "return":0,
        "message":"Success",
        "data": [
            {"id": 0, "name": "Test", "type": "type1", "extra": {"tag": 0}}, 
            {"id": 1, "name": "Other Test", "type": "type2", "extra": {"tag": 100}},
            {"id": 2, "name": "Another Test", "type": "type1", "extra": {"tag": 200}}
        ]
    }
    ```
    
    If you wanted to target objects whose tag is less than `100`, you could use
    the payload `{"extra__tag__lt": 100}`. This returns:<br><br>

    ```json

    {
        "status":"ok",
        "code":200,
        "return":0,
        "message":"Success",
        "data": [
            {"id": 0, "name": "Test", "type": "type1", "extra": {"tag": 0}}  
        ]
    }
    
    ```

    ### Less Than or Equal To
    
    The `lte` filter allows you to target objects whose values are less than or
    equal to a specific number. This will work on both numeric strings and
    integer data types. Below is an example response without any queries:<br><br>

    ```json

    {
        "status":"ok",
        "code":200,
        "return":0,
        "message":"Success",
        "data": [
            {"id": 0, "name": "Test", "type": "type1", "extra": {"tag": 0}}, 
            {"id": 1, "name": "Other Test", "type": "type2", "extra": {"tag": 100}},
            {"id": 2, "name": "Another Test", "type": "type1", "extra": {"tag": 200}}
        ]
    }
    
    ```

    If you wanted to target objects whose tag is less than or equal to `100`,
    you could use the payload `{"extra__tag__lte": 100}`. This returns:<br><br>

    ```json

    {
        "status":"ok",
        "code":200,
        "return":0,
        "message":"Success",
        "data": [
            {"id": 0, "name": "Test", "type": "type1", "extra": {"tag": 0}},
            {"id": 1, "name": "Other Test", "type": "type2", "extra": {"tag": 100}}
        ]
    }
    
    ```

    ### Greater Than
    The `gt` filter allows you to target objects whose values are greater than a
    specific number. This will work on both numeric strings and integer data
    types. Below is an example response without any queries:<br><br>
    
    ```json

    {
        "status":"ok",
        "code":200,
        "return":0,
        "message":"Success",
        "data": [
            {"id": 0, "name": "Test", "type": "type1", "extra": {"tag": 0}}, 
            {"id": 1, "name": "Other Test", "type": "type2", "extra": {"tag": 100}},
            {"id": 2, "name": "Another Test", "type": "type1", "extra": {"tag": 200}}
        ]
    }
    
    ```
    
    If you wanted to target objects whose tag is greater than `100`, you could
    use the payload `{"extra__tag__gt": 100}`. This returns:<br><br>

    ```json

    {
        "status":"ok",
        "code":200,
        "return":0,
        "message":"Success",
        "data": [
            {"id": 2, "name": "Another Test", "type": "type1", "extra": {"tag": 200}}  
        ]
    }
    
    ```

    ### Greater Than or Equal To
    
    The `lte` filter allows you to target objects whose values are greater than
    or equal to a specific number. This will work on both numeric strings and
    integer data types. Below is an example response without any queries:<br><br>

    ```json

    {
        "status":"ok",
        "code":200,
        "return":0,
        "message":"Success",
        "data": [
            {"id": 0, "name": "Test", "type": "type1", "extra": {"tag": 0}}, 
            {"id": 1, "name": "Other Test", "type": "type2", "extra": {"tag": 100}},
            {"id": 2, "name": "Another Test", "type": "type1", "extra": {"tag": 200}}
        ]
    }
    
    ```

    If you wanted to target objects whose tag is greater than or equal to `100`,
    you could use the payload `{"extra__tag__gte": 100}`. This returns:<br><br>

    ```json

    {
        "status":"ok",
        "code":200,
        "return":0,
        "message":"Success",
        "data": [
            {"id": 1, "name": "Other Test", "type": "type2", "extra": {"tag": 100}},
            {"id": 2, "name": "Another Test", "type": "type1", "extra": {"tag": 200}}
        ]
    }
    
    ```

    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Obtaining Object IDs</summary>
    
    You may notice some API endpoints require an object `id` to update or delete
    objects. These IDs are not stored values, rather pfSense uses the object's
    array index value to locate and identify objects. Unless specified
    otherwise, API endpoints will use the same array index value (as returned in
    the `data` response field) to locate objects when updating or deleting. Some
    important items to note about these IDs:<br><br>

    - pfSense starts arrays with an index of 0. If you use a loop counter to
    determine the ID of a specific object, you must start that counter at 0.
    
    - These IDs are dynamic. For example, if you have 3 static route objects
    stored (IDs `0`, `1`, and `2`) and you _delete_ the object with ID `1`,
    pfSense will resort the array so the object with ID `2` will now have an ID
    of `1`.
    
    - API queries will retain the object's ID in the response. In the event that
    the `data` response field is no longer a sequential array due to the query,
    the `data` field will be represented as an associative array with the array
    items` key being the objects ID.

    </details>


    ### Requirements for queries:
    
    - API call must be successful and return `0` in the `return` field.
    
    - Endpoints must return an array of objects in the data field (e.g. `[{"id":
    0, "name": "Test"}, {"id": 1, "name": "Other Test"}]`).
    
    - At least two objects must be present within the data field to support
    queries.
    
    # Limitations
    
    There are a few key limitations to keep in mind while using this API:<br><br>
    
    - pfSense's XML configuration was not designed for quick simultaneous writes
    like a traditional database. It may be necessary to delay API calls in
    sequence to prevent unexpected behavior such as configuration overwrites.
    
    - By design, values stored in pfSense's XML configuration can only be parsed as strings,
    arrays or objects. This means that even though request data requires data to be of a 
    certain type, it will not necessarily be stored as that type. Data read from the API
    may be represented differently than the format it was requested as.
